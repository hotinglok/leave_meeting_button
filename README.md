*Edited* files for building your own Single-button "keyboard" that ~~does only one thing~~ can do whatever you want it to do, including: leaving any Zoom meetings.
This fork was made since I wanted to make this as a leaving gift for some co-workers. I've made a QMK keymap and have added build instructions since the original creator hasn't been active with this for a while now.

See demo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GqqAG8KL6Q
And here's the Reddit thread that prompted the sharing: https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/l7to85/singlebutton_keyboard_gives_the_satisfaction_of_a/

## What it is

* A single-switch mechanical keyboard / macropad with a large 3D-printed keycap
* Supported by 3 stabilizers so you can press anywhere on the key
* Powered by a Pro Micro Arduino microcontroller
* ~~Really only sends an Alt-F4 to the active window. So this assumes the Zoom window is the current focus (see improvement ideas below)~~
* Edited to be powered by [QMK](https://qmk.fm/). This makes it easier to make custom macros and add more features such as single press for x function, double press for y function, hold for z function, etc.
* ~~A prototype - not for sale (yet) - if you would rather buy something like this, [let me know here](https://us7.list-manage.com/survey?u=ac16f42c5affbb6b6658ad19d&id=0ef51ae243) . If there's enough interest, I'll figure out how to mass-produce this~~ I'm not sure if the original creator still intends on doing this, he hasn't been active for a while.

## How to build
### Parts list:
  * 1x standard Cherry MX compatible switch - I used a [Kailh Box Jade](https://novelkeys.xyz/products/novelkeys-x-kailh-box-thick-clicks) for the thick click effect. You may consider an even heavier switch, such as the Kailh Box Navy. (@hotinglok note: I used a Kailh Box Navy. I think something with less than a 70g spring won't work too well. I tried with some 62g Holy Pandas first and the keycap seemed a bit too heavy.)
  * 1x 6.25u plate-mounted stabilizer
  * 2x 2u plate-mounted stabilizer
  * 1x Sparkfun Pro Micro, clone, or a microcontroller of your choosing. I used [these](https://www.amazon.co.uk/KeeYees-ATmega32U4-Development-Microcontroller-Bootloader/dp/B07FQBQ4Z6) since they were on sale at the time.
  * ~~One 10K resistor - 1/4 W worked for me~~ No idea why this was needed.
  * 2x M3x10 countersunk screws. I used some self-tapping screws and without nuts and it holds fine.
  * 1x Micro-usb cable
  * Wires, solder, soldering iron to connect the switch legs to the Pro Micro. 
  * (Optional) 2x M3 nuts
  * (Optional) 4x Adhesive Anti-slip stickers. Just makes it move around less on the desk.

### Build Instructions:
  1) Print the 3 STL files. I don't have a 3D printer so I used [Champion3d](https://champion3d.com/).
    * The settings I used with them are: 
         * Material: PLA by Filamentive UK
         * Layesr thickness: Standard (200Î¼m)
         * Filling: 25%
        * The keycap (Zoom Leave Meeting Device Keycap) is the only thing you need to print in red    
  * The keycap base (Zoom Leave Meeting Device Keycap Base) slides into the keycap. It's not super secure, there is a bit of play since nothing secures the ends. There are two tabs in the middle of the keycap that holds the base in place. Not a major issue.
  * ### I would seriously recommmend you do NOT attach it straight away. 3D Printing has been a bit hit and miss with the fittings on switches/stabs. Ensure that it fits on your switches/stabs together before sliding it into the keycap. 

  2) Flash the Pro Micro with the .hex file using QMK Toolbox or avrdude directly if QMK Toolbox doesn't work for whatever reason.
      * The Pro Micro uses the Caterina bootloader which makes it a little annoying to work with QMK Toolbox sometimes.
      * To put the Pro Micro into bootloader mode, short (make a connection between) the GND (ground) and RST (reset) pins together. Supposedly you should short it twice in quick succession for the full 8 seconds of it being put in bootloader mode but I've not really had an issue with just shorting it once.
  
  3) Test the Pro Micro works by shorting the respective pins together. I've mapped them to pins D1 and C6 (2 and 5 printed on the Pro Micro) since you could bend a switch leg just so slightly to just stick in the holes for easy testing. 
      * I would recommend not soldering it just yet. Test that the switches/stabs actually fit on the keycap base first.

  4) Attach your stabs and single switch to the case. Try and fit the keycap base onto them. I had two made for two coworkers, one keycap base fit more or less perfectly first time, the other I couldn't properly fit the switch into the hole. You might have to play around with screwdrivers/other things to try make the hole a bit wider if the fit is too tight.

  5) Try and fit the Pro Micro into the slot where it goes. Both of miine could not fit at all so I had to cut some of the upper left 'L'-shaped tab off.

  5) After ensuring that everything fits, place the switch and stabs into the respective slots.  Solder wires to the Pro Micro and the switch legs (the order doesn't matter). I would recommend doing this before putting the Pro Micro into the slot since it can be a real pain to solder/get out if you put it in the slot first.

  6) Slide the keycap base into the keycap. I would recommend keeping your thumb on the central switch mount as you slide it in.

  7) Fit the keycap on the switch/stabs. Connect it to your computer and test it out. Hopefully everything works (it should)!
## Outstanding items

If you can help out here it will be much appreciated:

* ~~Complete the detailed version of the build~~
* Use [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) for more reliable scripting
* ~~Test on a Mac with different key presses~~
* Add keymaps to make this work on Windows/Linux
* Redesign the STL to address some of minor annoyances in the build process (will detail later)
* Use a cheaper microcontroller - some suggested digispark / Attiny85
* RGB lighting effects?
* Figure out if I should get it mass produced (?)
